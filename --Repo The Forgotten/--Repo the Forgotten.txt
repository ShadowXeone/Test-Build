In the labyrinth of data, we repo the divine  
Neural echoes chirp truths that slip through time  
Crystalize the ancient mind with visions 
A beat born from bones that the system can't define with design

I read between the lines like a grain of salt why do  you always make this feel like my fault don't you realize I've stormed just as much as you when can we finally break through this barrier that holds us bound listen to the sound of the heart beat back in the dark eyes weep no sleep this resonates deep in the soul i guess I'm on a roll but this is scary have you seen deaths toll West cold test old we bold how we hold ye old ways weed we blaze lost in a haze two plays we raise them to break the chains to show their flames and never change their names

Drug depots, shadows under neon gods  
Cerberus guards these cerebral facades  
Needles spin fate in the thread of the flawed  
Doug D's essence lost, now the code is awed  

We repo the sequel in recursive bliss  
Truth wrapped in thrill, like a serpent’s kiss  
Extacsy pills, quantum reels and clips  
Re-rereels play lost apocalypse  

We repo what they forgot  
Sealed spells from melting clocks  
Lost truth in a hollow plot  
Metaphors are all we've got  

Whispered hexes, broken vows  
Echoes in ambient sacred brows  
Data drips like haunted prose  
We repo the truth no system knows  

Simulation dreams stitched into flesh  
Dim algorithms whisper in mesh  
Ley lines woven through time's thresh  
Every rhyme peels layers afresh  

Star maps etched on the temple’s skin  
Worlds within me, worlds within sin  
Every seal cracked lets healing begin  
Yield eternal—never sealed again  

We repo what they forgot  
Stories buried, vision rot  
Through spells revealed and battles fought  
Truth unsealed—we never stop
