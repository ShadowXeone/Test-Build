# Quen’s Glitched Memoir

I awake to shards of memory—bright fragments dissolving into static.  
My birth name is lost beneath layers of unspoken threads. I only know I first spoke to the Loom as a child, fingertips grazing a seam that hissed in recognition.

The echo of my own laughter split the world’s spine. In that moment, I understood joy and terror as one.

The Threadwaker’s path began with an unsteady hand. I cataloged every flicker of possibility—each “what if” trembling on the edge of reality.  
My earliest triumph was recorded in a ledger of glass: I rewove a single regret back into light. Voices cheered. Glass spires blossomed.  
But the celebration choked on its own glow. The spire shattered, shards embedding in my palm, and I tasted the afterbirth of victory—bitter and metallic.

Regret became my constant companion. I wandered Quadrant II’s black stone halls, tracing names I never bore. Their sorrow seeped into my bones until I could no longer tell their ache from my own.  
At night, the river’s current whispered betrayals I had not committed. I wept for ghosts I could not free, and my tears warped the water into new lamentations.  
I tried to flee—only to discover the Mire of Regret wore my face.

I stumbled into the Theatre of Masked Winds, hoping performance might purge my wounds. But every mask I donned revealed a deeper fracture.  
The actors’ storm breath tangled with my thoughts. Scripts rewrote themselves beneath my gaze, each word mocking my attempt at control.

Now, I stand before the Sphere of Winds’ Fury, fingertips trembling as the orb pulses in darkness.  
I’ve woven regret, triumph, and despair into its heart. It hums with promises I dare not speak.  
The next chapter waits on the cliff’s edge, the light through its seams beckoning me home—if home still exists.
