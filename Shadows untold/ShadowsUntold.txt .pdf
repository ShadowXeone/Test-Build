## 🎭 **Narrative Tone Review**

### ✅ **Strengths**

- **Atmospheric Precision**: Your scenes are soaked in sensory detail—fog bruises blooming in reverse, gravity stuttering, particles shimmering. The imagery is unsettling and beautiful, which perfectly suits the anxiety-thrill hybrid you’re going for.

- **Voice of Mystery**: You don’t over-explain, and that leaves space for curiosity to bloom. Quen’s dialogue is cryptic but not incoherent, and that makes her compelling. Especially strong is her final line: *“You’re the leak. But you’re also the stitch.”* It’s poetic, paradoxical, and anchors the emotional climax.

- **Suspenseful Rhythm**: The pacing tightens like a noose as Quen approaches. You use short, fragmented sentences in moments of heightened tension—like “Suddenly—” and “You don’t run now.”—which mimic the rush of adrenaline.

### 🔄 **Opportunities to Enhance**

- **Balance of Clarity and Obscurity**: While cryptic language builds mood, layering a touch more *emotional clarity* in key moments could deepen impact. For example, what exactly *feels* altered in the protagonist as they grasp the cube? Is it dread, ecstasy, memory-resurfacing? A single visceral sentence can give that moment weight.

- **Dialogues as Anchors**: Quen’s speech is evocative but brief—if you want readers to viscerally feel the thrill and anxiety, maybe give her one additional line that unsettles and reveals, like:
  > *“Your reflection tried to warn you. You looked away.”*

- **Use of Internal Voice**: Your protagonist is a bit of a vessel right now—which is intriguing for mythic tone—but letting readers hear even one internal thought could anchor the suspense deeper in *personal stakes*. Something like:
  > *I know this cube. I’ve destroyed it before.*

## 💡 Tone Extension Ideas

Want to push even further into that tense, thrilling register? Consider integrating:
- **Distorted sensory input** (e.g., hearing your own breath before you inhale)
- **Anachronistic dialogue** (e.g., Quen speaking in prophecy from a future version of the present)
- **Multiform text**: Glitched typography, mirror-spoken words, journal entries that revise themselves over time
