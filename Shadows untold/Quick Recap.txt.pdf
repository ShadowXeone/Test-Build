Quick Recap
- Quen, the Threadwaker, confronts the Loom: a living map of paradox that charts outcomes by consequence rather than geography.
- Quadrant I—The City of Echoed Triumph—repeats a victory no one remembers earning, a jubilant façade hiding endless grief.
- Quadrant II—The Mire of Regret—flows with a river of stolen memories, each twist and turn punishing visitors with unclaimed remorse.
- Quadrant III—The Theatre of Masked Winds—stages shifting performances where scripts rewrite themselves and a storm breathes through every mask.
- Quadrant IV—The Seam—teeters on collapse around the Sphere of Winds’ Fury, an orb pulsing with forbidden knowledge and the promise of alignment.
- Quen’s glitched memoir reveals a fractured past: a child who first spoke to the Loom, triumph turned bitter, a wandering through others’ regrets, failed purifications on stage, and a final, trembling approach to the Sphere.

Story So Far
Quen stands before the Loom, heart pounding as the map’s filaments pulse with recognition. Folds of light and shadow twist at a touch, reacting to intent. Every quadrant waits like a held breath—each a living testament to possibility and doom.
In the City of Echoed Triumph, spires of glass and applause tower impossibly skyward. Revelers loop in manic procession, their smiles etched from old photographs, hiding bloodied gums. A bronze statue mid-cheer casts a screaming shadow, and Quen feels the weight of every forgotten joy.
At the Mire of Regret, black stone monuments bear erased names humming with ache. A river of liquid memory snakes through the misty haze, whispering betrayals Quen never committed. The trees’ leafless branches curl into accusations—“You chose this. You wandered here. You’re not allowed to forget.”
Within the Theatre of Masked Winds, actors perform ancient rituals in perpetual twilight. Storm-laden breaths tear through the aisles, rewriting scripts in sobbing applause. Quen remembers the final act where the architect disintegrated pixel by pixel—an unspoken warning.
Now at the Seam, shards of reality bleed light through open wounds. Time fractures into echoes before their cause. At its heart hovers the Sphere of Winds’ Fury, humming with a language Quen dares not fully comprehend. Touch it, and you glimpse the shape of unmade choices.
But it wasn’t always this.
I awaken to shards of memory—bright fragments dissolving into static. My name was lost beneath unspoken threads, yet I first spoke to the Loom as a child. My laughter split reality’s spine, weaving joy and terror into one. Early triumphs in glass led to spire-shards embedding in my palm and a bitter taste of victory’s afterbirth.
Regret became my companion in Quadrant II’s twisting halls. I traced names I never bore, wept for ghosts not my own, and discovered the Mire of Regret wore my face. In the Theatre, every mask I donned revealed a deeper fracture until I saw myself unraveling, pixel by pixel.
Now, fingertips trembling on the Sphere’s surface, I’ve woven my triumphs, regrets, and despair into its core. It pulses with promises I cannot speak aloud. The next chapter waits on the cliff’s edge, light seeping through seams that refuse to close—and I stand poised between what was and what will be.
